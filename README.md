# Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis
# Overview of the analysis: 

The purpose of this analysis was to create a neural network model which will determine whether applicants will be successful if they are funded by Alphabet Soup. There are 34000 organizations that have received funding from Alphabet soup over the years. The data set contains the following: 

•	EIN and NAME—Identification columns

•	APPLICATION_TYPE—Alphabet Soup application type

•	AFFILIATION—Affiliated sector of industry

•	CLASSIFICATION—Government organization classification

•	USE_CASE—Use case for funding

•	ORGANIZATION—Organization type

•	STATUS—Active status

•	INCOME_AMT—Income classification

•	SPECIAL_CONSIDERATIONS—Special consideration for application

•	ASK_AMT—Funding amount requested.

•	IS_SUCCESSFUL—Was the money used effectively.

# Results: 

## Data Preprocessing:

We have targeted for the model is “IS_Successful” Flag. 

These are the features used for the model: 

•	APPLICATION_TYPE—Alphabet Soup application type

•	AFFILIATION—Affiliated sector of industry

•	CLASSIFICATION—Government organization classification

•	USE_CASE—Use case for funding

•	ORGANIZATION—Organization type

•	STATUS—Active status

•	INCOME_AMT—Income classification

•	SPECIAL_CONSIDERATIONS—Special consideration for application

•	ASK_AMT—Funding amount requested.

•	NAME-An identifier column that is used to filter out 'first time' applicants.

•	EIN column was removed from the dataset as it is used for identification purposes. 

## Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model
•	How many neurons, layers, and activation functions did you select for your neural network model, and why?
•	Were you able to achieve the target model performance?
• What steps did you take to try and increase model performance?

# Summary: 
Summarize the overall results of the deep learning model. Include a recommendation for how a different model could solve this classification problem, and explain your recommendation.
